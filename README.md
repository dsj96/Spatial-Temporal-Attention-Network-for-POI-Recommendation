Author Reply: Thank you for your interest in our work! I summarize some FAQs here:  
1) Can you provide a dataset?  
The dataset will come out soon, please forgive me. I am tied up with other papers and reviews to do. I will deal with it in weekends.
2) I ran into some problems in reading the paper or inplementing the codes. May I talk/discuss with you?  
It would be my pleasure to answer your questions. Please do not hesitate to email me or leave comments at any time and explain the problem concisely so I can assist.  
3) What is the environment to run the code? And version?  
We use python 3.7.2 with CUDA 10.1 and PyTorch 1.7.1. Make sure to install all required libs that we import.  
4) Are you open to cooperation?  
I always welcome collaborations, although it is highly recommended to drop me an outline of research proposal first. :}
